The game-loop is a sequence of processes that run continuously 
as long as the game is running. The three main processes that occur
 in the game-loop are input, update, and render. Lucky for you, 
 we have provided the game-loop. Make sure to include the following 
 function in your program:

#include <stdlib.h>
// game-loop for Hangman
void gameLoop() {
    int difficulty, tries;
    string word, current;
    char letter;
    while (true) {
        cout << "Welcome to Hangman!" << endl;
        cout <<  "0. easy\n1. normal\n2. hard\n3. exit\nChoose a difficulty: ";
        cin >> difficulty;
        while (difficulty < 0 || difficulty > 3) {
            cout <<  "Enough horseplay >_< !\n0. easy\n1. normal\n2. hard\n3. exit\nChoose a difficulty: ";
            cin >> difficulty;
        }
        if (difficulty == 3) {
            cout << "If you're hangry, go grab a bite! See what I did there?" << endl;
            break;
        }
        word = getRandomWord();
        current = maskWord(word);
        tries = getTries(difficulty);
        while (tries != 0) {
            cout << "Life: ";
            printAttempts(tries, difficulty);
            cout << endl << "Word: "<< current << endl;

            cout << "The word is \"" << word << "\". Better luck next time! You're getting the ..ahem.. hang of it." << endl;
        }
        else {
